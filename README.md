# Advent Of Code '2015

I play this in Dec'21, so there is no track record or stats.

## Diary

* `day 01:`
* `day 02:`
* `day 03:`
* `day 04 (26, 48):` Wasted some time to find clever solution, but brute force was enough.
* `day 05:`

## Usage
After installing with npm or yarn, just type `./run` or `node .` and the puzzles from the most recent
day will run.

The following command line parameters apply:
* an integer: number for a day (several numbers may be supplied);
* -0, -1, -2: use the main dataset (-0), or some with higher number (default: all datasets).
* 'a': all - puzzles for existing days will be solved (overrides dy numbers if any);
