# Advent Of Code '2015

I play this in Dec'21, so there is no track record or stats.

## Diary

* `day 01 (04, 10):` Super simple.
* `day 02 (17, 22):` Super simple.
* `day 03 (17, 26):` Quite simple.
* `day 04 (26, 48):` Wasted some time to find clever solution, but brute force was enough.
* `day 05 (24, 52):` Quite simple.
* `day 06 (47, 57):` Carelessness with regExp syntax!.

## Usage

After installing with npm or yarn, just type `./run` or `node .` and the puzzles from the most
recent day will run.

The following command line parameters apply:

* integer - day number(s), (default: most recent day only);
* a: all days;
* b: both datasets (default: main data only);
* d: example data only (mutually exclusive with 'b' option;
* h: print help information and terminate.
